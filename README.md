The files include PyTorch basics such as Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Linear Regression using PyTorch and Tensorboard. 
The "HeartDisease" file is an extension of my thesis, Interpretability of Classification and Regression Ensemble Models. 
In this file, I implemented a simple Neural Network to model the heart disease dataset and further analyzed it using SHAP explanations.
